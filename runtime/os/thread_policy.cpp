// gta4port: thread names and core placement (see thread_policy.h). The placement follows what
// the Modern Combat 4 port measured on this phone (mc4-arm64-port/src/hle/affinity.cpp):
// - HyperOS/MediaTek rewrite a thread's cpuset every few seconds, which resets its mask, so the
//   masks are re-applied: the main thread's every 100 ms, the others every 2 seconds;
// - with the SoC hot, core_ctl pauses the fastest core; sched_setaffinity still succeeds but the
//   thread runs elsewhere. Seen off it 3 checks in a row, the main thread moves to the big
//   cluster for 2 seconds and then tries again.
// Roles: the game's main thread gets the fastest core alone; the busiest other threads get the
// other big cores; everything else runs anywhere except the fastest core. The game names only
// one thread (PathServerThread), so "busy" is measured: every 2 seconds each thread's CPU time
// is read from /proc, and a thread above PROMOTE_SHARE of a core moves to the big cores (at most
// MAX_BUSY of them) until it drops below DEMOTE_SHARE. Measured in TLAD (2026-10-23): main ~46%,
// audio engine ~52%, render ~25%, one more game thread ~25%, all others under 20%.
// A runtime thread (gta4-affinity) does all of this; the game's own loops are not hooked
// because the main loop changes between the menus and the game.
// The game's render and sound threads are known by their entry point (KnownGuestThreadName) and
// stay on the big cores: measured on 2026-10-26, the render thread dropped under DEMOTE_SHARE
// while it waited for the renderer and was sent to the little cores ~90 times in 6 minutes (one
// stutter each). A busy thread also needs QUIET_SWEEPS quiet sweeps in a row before it leaves the
// big cores. Audio and vblank threads wake often and do little work: they run anywhere but the
// fastest core at normal priority (on the little cores at nice +4 their wakeups came late).
// The game's render thread also gets a big core of its own (Role::Render, the last big core before
// the fastest): sharing cores 4-6, it lost ~20% of its time to the renderer threads it wakes for
// every batch of commands (wakeup preemption), while the game's main thread waited for it.
// The game's task and job workers (Role::Worker, named by entry point in ExCreateThread) are what
// the main thread waits for ~77% of its time, but each one is too quiet to count as busy, so they
// ran on the little cores. They now run on every big core, the main and render cores included
// (those threads wait 77% and 60% of the time), at nice 5: low enough that a waking worker never
// preempts the thread that owns the core (CFS wakeup granularity), so they fill idle big cores.
// GtaRecorder (Role::Recorder) records each frame's Vulkan commands and caps the frame rate
// (~38 ms of a ~45 ms frame, 2026-10-26). It shares cores 4-5 (99% busy) with GtaSoundThread,
// GtaRenderWorker and busy game threads, all at nice -6, and lost time to each of their wakeups;
// it now runs on the same cores at nice -10, so it is not preempted by them and gets ~2.4x their
// share when the cores are contended. Only the recorder itself: the Vulkan driver's threads are
// created from it and inherit its name (4 of them, 2026-10-26), and at nice -10 they took the
// sound threads' time.
// GtaSoundThread (the game's mixer) and gta4-audio (the XAudio clock, apu/null_driver.cpp) are
// Role::Audio: big cores at nice -12, above the recorder. With the recorder at -10 and the sound
// thread at -6 on the same two 98%-busy cores, the sound came out distorted (2026-10-26).
// Layout mode C (2026-10-27, files/layout_mode): cores 4-5 were ~99% busy with the recorder (69%
// of a core), the sound threads (57%) and GtaRenderWorker (34%), while the fastest core ran
// gta4-main at 19% (it waits for the task workers 77% of its time). GtaRenderWorker now shares the
// fastest core with gta4-main at nice -6 (Role::PrimeShared; gta4-main at -10 goes first), and the
// fake GPU's ring thread gta4-gpu (1% of a core in many short wakeups, each a preemption on the
// recorder's cores) runs anywhere but the fastest core. Mode D puts the recorder alone on the
// fastest core (Role::RecorderPrime, with the main thread's core_ctl fallback) and gta4-main on the
// big cores; mode A is the placement before, and the default again: hot, the fastest core is
// throttled below the others and C lost 4 fps to A (ReadLayoutMode).
// GTA4_AFFINITY=0 disables placement (names are still set).

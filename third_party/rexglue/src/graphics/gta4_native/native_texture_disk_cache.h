// gta4port: DXT textures transcoded to ETC2 on the GPU (texture_detile_cs.glsl), kept in the
// phone's storage. GTA streams the same textures in and out as the player moves, and each time a
// compute pass converted every block again; a texture converted once is now read back from the
// cache and uploaded as it is.
// Files in the cache directory:
//   textures.pack:  records appended one after another (RecordHeader, then the converted bytes);
//   textures.index: one IndexEntry per record, written only after its record's bytes are synced,
//                   so an entry never names bytes that a crash lost.
// Both start with a FileHeader whose version covers this layout and the conversion shader; any
// mismatch starts the cache over. One thread does all the file work: reads asked for when a texture
// is captured (Prefetch) are usually done before the recorder needs them (if not, the texture is
// converted on the GPU as before), and stores come from the recorder once the GPU has completed the
// frame that converted them.
